"This project utilizes OpenCV, a computer vision library, for real-time face detection. Leveraging pre-trained Haar cascades, it identifies and highlights faces within video frames."

Tech Stack:
python,
opencv-open computer vision,
Haar cascades-object detection algorithm

Running Tests
To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  create a virtual environmnt
```
